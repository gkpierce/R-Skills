## Background
The global burden of leprosy or Hansen’s Disease, a chronic infectious disease, decreased considerably in the past four decades but remains a major cause of disability.$^1$ While leprosy trended downward worldwide, cases have recently increased in Africa, particularly East Africa. Some countries in this region are on the World Health Organization’s global priority list, accounting for most new cases.$^2$ Research suggests that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine offers protection against mycobacterial infections, including leprosy.$^{3,4}$ This study aims to investigate whether BCG vaccination against tuberculosis in early childhood was associated with lower odds of leprosy in East Africa.

## Study Design
We employed an unmatched case-control study design.  Cases consisted of patients aged 5 years or older with a new diagnosis of leprosy, using a standard case definition of the disease. Population-based controls were aged 5 years or older and leprosy-free, and identified through a cross-sectional survey questionnaire. A total of 274 cases and 1,096 controls were included in this study. 

## Statistical Methods
Characteristics of the study population were summarized using absolute counts and corresponding proportions. For our main confirmatory analysis, we fit an adjusted multivariable logistic regression model to evaluate the association between BCG vaccination in early childhood and new leprosy diagnosis. The exposure, BCG vaccination, was a binary variable. Participants were considered vaccinated when a vaccination scar was present and unvaccinated when absent, coded as “1” and “0”, respectively. The outcome was a new diagnosis of leprosy, also a binary variable, coded as “1” if present and “0” if absent.  We selected confounding variables *a priori* using subject matter knowledge;$^5$ they are presented in a directed acyclic graph, see Figure 1, and described in detail in Table 1. In our main analysis, we adjusted for the following: sex (male or female); categorized age in years (5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-44, or 45 and older) as indicator variables; housing type (brick, sunbrick, wattle, or temporary) as indicator variables; and level of formal education (none, 1-5 years, 6-8 years, or secondary/tertiary level) as indicator variables. We used complete-case analysis, excluding participants with missing data. We estimated p-values and 95% confidence intervals (CI) with robust standard errors using a Wald’s approach. To check the robustness of our findings, we refit the main analysis model excluding participants aged >=30 years (i.e., 135 cases and 307 controls). All tests were two-sided and we set an alpha level of 0.05. 

## Results
A total of 47 (17.2%) cases and 500 (45.6%) controls were vaccinated with BCG. Sociodemographic characteristics of cases and controls were similar (Table 2). In our main analysis, the odds of leprosy diagnosis for those who received a BCG vaccination was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.23 - 0.52; p < 0.01) times the odds of those who did not receive a BCG vaccination, adjusted for age, sex, housing type, and education. Our estimate remained similar in additional analysis. After excluding patients aged >=30 years, the odds of leprosy diagnosis for those who received a BCG vaccination was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.25 - 0.60; p < 0.01) times the odds of those who did not receive a BCG vaccination, adjusted for age, sex, housing type, and education. 


## Discussion
We found an inverse association between BCG vaccination in early childhood and leprosy diagnosis among participants in East Africa. This study has numerous strengths: we captured new leprosy cases and minimized the possibility of length-biased sampling. Our research used real-world data from a regional, representative health survey, with information on key factors such as age, sex, housing type, and education. Further, we used an efficient study design to evaluate a relevant public health issue that should be confirmed in future studies. This study also presents several limitations. The potential misclassification of exposure status remains for BCG vaccination. Vaccinated participants who do not develop a BCG scar (a marker of impaired immune response) may be classified as unvaccinated and are at higher risk of developing leprosy.$^6$ In keeping, we did not have data on participants' immune status. BCG vaccination is contraindicated in immunocompromised patients, who are at a higher risk of developing leprosy.$^7$ Thus, our results may overestimate the association between BCG and leprosy. Finally, we did not measure variables such as income, comorbidities, or contact with patients living with leprosy. Thus, unmeasured confounding may be a threat to the validity of our findings. 
In conclusion, our study found an inverse association between BCG and leprosy in East Africa, suggesting that BCG vaccination early in life may be a protective factor for leprosy. Future investigations confirming our findings in additional settings and in dissimilar populations remain warranted.
